The R Markdown notebooks here show how the shRNA screen data from the
Novartis DRIVE project can be analyzed. The dataset contains read counts
for 398 cancer cell lines screened for 7837 genes with an average of 20
shRNAs per gene. The publication about this project (McDonald et al, 2017)
is available at http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(17)30812-7.pdf. DRIVE
raw data is available at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/y3ds55n88r/4 .
